# Pok-mon-Battle-using-Threading
This Pokémon Battle Simulator project allows two Pokémon to battle each other using threading to simulate actions in real time. Each Pokémon has its own set of moves with corresponding damage values. The battle includes attacking, defending, and running. The program tracks HP and ends when one Pokémon faints.
